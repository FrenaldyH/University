# Praktikum 1

&emsp;This was one of the Data Structures and Algorithms practicums, held on April 11, 2025, from 15:30 to 17:30. In this practicum, we were required to implement a data structure that we created from scratch. Due to the limited time, which was only 2 hours, my code may not be clean enough. I apologize if there are any unused variables or functions, as well as some leftover debug code.
